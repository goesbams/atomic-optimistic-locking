# Atomic Optimistic Locking

Atomic Optimistic Locking is a technique for managing concurrency in databases or distributed systems. It allows multiple transactions to read data without conflicts but ensures that only one transaction can successfully update the data if there are no external changes to it.

Why Atomic?
The term "atomic" in Atomic Optimistic Locking refers to the idea that the update operation happens indivisibly — it's an all-or-nothing action.

Here's why it's called atomic:

All-or-Nothing Update:
When a transaction tries to update data, it checks if the data's version (or state) has changed. If not, the update succeeds completely; if it has changed, the transaction fails without making any partial updates.

No Partial States:
Atomic operations leave no room for inconsistent states. Either the entire operation is applied, or none of it is — maintaining data integrity.

Isolation Guarantee:
Even if multiple transactions attempt to modify the same data concurrently, only one will succeed based on the version check, making it appear as if the operation happened in a single, indivisible step.
